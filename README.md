### Minuu
_Minimal templating engine for quick, component-based prototyping_
~~ReactJs for people who need simpler solutions~~

Want component-based prototyping or a way to quickly drop that navbar into every HTML page without copypasta everywhere?
Just drop the navbar into its own HTML file, and include it at the top of any html file you want. 

Includes are recursive, so you can include a page within a page within a page... you get it.

Much like `document.ready()`, minuu lets you know when it's done inlcuding everything with `minuu.ready()`.

## Usage
There are two ways to use minuu: 

### NPM package

### including minuu.js locally on index
